# About Me 
## My Interests 
-A personal hobby that I've been invested in for over two years now is learning to do tattoos, I design my own unique artwork and then practice it on fake skin. Luckily I was able to shadow an actual professional and get some experience tattooing some clients. 
## Websites I Recommend
 -[Behance](https://www.behance.net/) - Behance is a great website to use as inspiration when creating/designing websites, apps or even products. It's essentially a social media platform that showcases portfolios of designers from all over the world. I find it to be a great creative hub to get some inspiration and meet other creative minds.  
-[Codein Game](https://www.codingame.com/start/) - Codein Game is a great website to practice coding while playing games, I find it easier to absorb information if I'm learning it in a fun and interactive way, this site helps with that. There are mulitple games and difficulty levels, so that you may increase your skill level over time.
